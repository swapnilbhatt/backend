The Cards Game Application
=========================
 
This application simulates a card game and its main purpose is to provide the basis for a code review exercise.  

The application contains several intentional issues, some very obvious, others more subtle.

Developers taking this exercise need to implement two steps:

1 - Analyze, find issues and make suggestions to improve the application.  
2 - Fix issues and implement suggestions / improvements.

When analyzing or implementing changes to the applications one should keep in mind the following principles:

- General Software Engineering concepts
- Object Oriented Design principles
- Java Design Patterns
- Code Style / Formatting / Clarity
- Correctness and Validation

// -  ----------------------------------------//

1. Used factory pattern to allow use of multiple games
2. Made players part of relationship of game
3. Used separate classes for each card type and inherited from base card class
4. Replaced duplicate code in game
5. Allowed game to easily support more than 2 players
6. Set fixed no of cards per player for a particular game
